# 😼 Don’t Wake The Cat

A simple, tiny game made with **pure HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript**.
No libraries, no frameworks — just basic logic and fun.

Your job is to **click the cat only when it's asleep (😴)**.
If you click it when it's awake (😾), the game ends.

## How to play

1. Click **Start / Restart**
2. Watch the cat’s face
3. Click only when it’s sleeping
4. Each correct click increases your score

One wrong click = Game Over

## How to run

1. Create a file called `cat_game.html`
2. Paste the game code into it
3. Save and open it in your browser

That’s all. It works offline.
